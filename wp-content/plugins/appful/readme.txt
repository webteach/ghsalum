**Why we started**

Mobile apps became one of the driving forces of modern civilization. Studies recently discovered that we spend more than 80% of our time on our mobile devices in mobile apps. As a result, bloggers are required to follow this trend and create a mobile app - otherwise they are not able to reach their audience. The most important feature of a mobile app is push notifications. Through them, bloggers can directly reach their audience. A mobile app has many advantages, however it is usually very expensive in development. Our aim was to create a real alternative and set a new standard in the process of creating a mobile app and we think that we succeeded. 

**Who we are**

Two years ago, one member ran a blog and was desperatly looking for somebody that would develop him an mobile app for his blog. For the same reasons metioned above, he insisted on trying an mobile app in the form of an ios and android app because he was sure that a mobile app makes a huge difference in comparison to browsers. At first he did not find anybody who was able to develop his mobile app as an android app until he found the developer of our current team. We developed the mobile app together and it had tremendous success. We were so proud of our work and discovered a whole new world and everything that was possible in it - the world of mobile apps. What started as a little idea soon became a passion. We planned to build a company that provides the tools for bloggers to do the same. appful has been in development for 2 years and we are now very close friends. The love to mobile apps for ios and android and our passion is what keeps the company running. The times where you have to go to an agency and pay thousands of dollars to get a middle-class looking mobile app for ios and android are over. We provide you with a very affordable, stunning app for android and ios that can easily keep up with competitiors - more over your chances are good to get a very successful mobile app. We only take little fees to keep your app updated and running. Our mobile app company is now based in Germany and has a great success. We are very proud of what we already accomplished and looking forward to seeing what is going to follow. Be part of our story an try us free and get your own mobile app for your blog!

**Differences between mobile apps and mobile sites**

In every area of our lives we recognize the trend to mobiles devices and smartphones. Mobile Devices (Android Apps and iOS Apps) are everywhere and they are talking over task by task. We use a mobile app for communication, a mobile app for entertainment, a mobile app for booking, a mobile app for eating, a mobile app photos, a mobile app for meeting new people and especially a mobile app for getting informations and news on both android and ios.

== Other Notes ==

mobile App vs. mobile Web App vs. mobile site

In every area of our lives we recognize the trend to mobiles devices and smartphones. Mobile Devices (Android Apps and iOS Apps) are everywhere and they are talking over task by task. We use a mobile app for communication, a mobile app for entertainment, a mobile app for booking, a mobile app for eating, a mobile app photos, a mobile app for meeting new people and especially a mobile app for getting informations and news on both android and ios.

Did you know that we spend more than 80% in native mobile apps when we use our android and ios devices? As a result, less than 20% of our smartphone use time is spend in browsers where people read your blog, and the trend is growing towards a mobile app.

If you are a publisher with a large audience and do not have a mobile app yet, your readers have no possibility to be up-to-date with your news. Only through a native mobile app you can unfilteredly reach your target group through push notifications. In addition to that, a native mobile app creates a whole different feeling when using it. It can use the core advantages of native software and access powerful frameworks and offer tremendous features.

Since you are on our page, chances are that you have already tried out different mobile app builder solutions. You may have also noticed that a vast majority of mobile app builders are complex to use, look unprofessional and unclean and are very limited in both function and design. Furthermore, they are very expensive and often require a developer account that also costs more than 100$/year. On top of that, they limit push notifications for your mobile app.

We are bloggers ourselves and also discovered these issues when trying to create a mobile app. You can either use an overpriced mobile app builder or offer a professional agency that takes very long and is very expensive as well.

So we thought there has to be a better way and we invented appful - the golden mean between mobile app builders and agencies for an android app and an ios app. We offer a strong background system, take care of the whole process of publishing, managing and updating your mobile app for ios and android and offer affordable prices. Furthermore we enable you to better monetize your mobile app for android and ios and earn more money. We do not limit push notifications. Once set up, you never have to worry about your mobile app again. Push notifications are sent completly automatically - no action required. In our strong analytics system you can watch your mobile app growing.

The best thing is that we want you to be happy with your app so we decided not to charge any money until you are 100% satisfied and decide to release your mobile app for ios to the app store and your android app to the play store. You can try and experiment with every function and design your mobile app as long as you like for free and test your android app and ios app on your devices.

Once you are content with your mobile app you can hand it over to us and we will take care of the remaining process. We will hand your iOS App over to Apple and your Android App to Google and offer strong servers that process the content of your mobile app. Your site does not have to struggle with an extra amount of traffic.
